**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic that was covered in my domain was how Prism cleans its data and engineers features that they deem to be useful for their algorithms. It was interesting to hear the different approaches that they take and the extended through process that goes behind each decision. It gave insight into something that I never would have even thought twice about.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation that I would like to pursue is exploring more into the use of LLM's and our more complex models, because although they didn't perform as well, I feel like these advanced models could still be used in a more effective way than how we are currently utilizing them. 

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change that I'd make to the approach in our Quarter 1 project is going back to our work from week 3 and trying to tweak our memo cleaning algorithm a bit more. Given the feedback and insight that we gained these past couple of weeks, I feel like we have a better understanding of the dataset and can see poential improvements that could be made. I think that we could spend more time just going back and reiterating on our previous week's work before moving on to the next task each week.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Some other techniques that I would be interested in using are character level n-grams and maybe creating additional features that analyze spending trends/habits from a consumer level. I think that these are some techniques that could help improve our model.
